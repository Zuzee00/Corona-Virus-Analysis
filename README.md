Analysing Corona Virus data using data visualizations on Tableau.

### Percentage Recovery 
Data shows that even states closer to the epicenter of virus origin are recovering quickly but those far away have lower percentages. On further analysis I found out that this behaviour is due to difference in number of people affected.
- Areas with high number of confirmed cases tend to have low recovery percentage
