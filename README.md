# Corona-Virus-Analysis
Analysing Corona Virus data using data visualizations on Tableau.

## China
### Percentage Recovery 
Data shows that even states closer to the epicenter of virus origin are recovering quickly but those far away have lower percentages. On further analysis I found out that this behaviour is due to difference in number of people affected.
- States with high number of confirmed cases tend to have low recovery percentage

### Death Percentage Analysis
Data shows that Hubei has the highest death percentage. States closer to the epicenter of virus origin have low death percentage but a few far away have high death percentage.
We can conclude that:
- States with greater number of confirmed cases tend to have high death percentage
- CONVID19 can become deadly if it effects more and more people

## Australia
Following visualization shows that:
- Queensland has the most confirmed cases (159)
- Western Australia has the least confirmed cases (6)
- New South Wales has the highest recovery percentage (70.27%) while having the second most number of confirmed cases (148)
- Western Australia has the highest death rate (33.33%). But this could be misleading and can create panic among masses if someone only presents the death percentage because the number of confirmed cases in Western Australia is the lowest (6) while the other parts of Australia are more effected by CONVID19 yet nobody died there due to virus. 

The point I am trying to make that people can misguide you with visualization even having credible data. so please before panicking just dig in a little and find some context to the provided visualization and you'll find out how you have been misguided.
